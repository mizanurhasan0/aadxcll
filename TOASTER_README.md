# Toaster Notification System

This project now uses a custom toaster notification system instead of browser alerts. The toaster provides a much better user experience with styled notifications that auto-dismiss and can be manually dismissed.

## Components

### 1. Toaster Component (`src/components/shared/Toaster.tsx`)
The main toaster component that renders the toast notifications. It displays toasts in the top-right corner of the screen with different styles based on the message type.

### 2. useToaster Hook (`src/components/shared/useToaster.ts`)
A custom React hook that manages the toast state and provides methods to show different types of notifications.

## Usage

### Basic Setup

1. Import the hook and component in your component:
```tsx
import { useToaster } from '@/components/shared/useToaster';
import Toaster from '@/components/shared/Toaster';
```

2. Use the hook in your component:
```tsx
const { toasts, removeToast, showSuccess, showError, showWarning, showInfo } = useToaster();
```

3. Add the Toaster component to your JSX:
```tsx
return (
    <div>
        <Toaster toasts={toasts} removeToast={removeToast} />
        {/* Your component content */}
    </div>
);
```

### Available Methods

- `showSuccess(message, duration?)` - Shows a green success notification
- `showError(message, duration?)` - Shows a red error notification  
- `showWarning(message, duration?)` - Shows a yellow warning notification
- `showInfo(message, duration?)` - Shows a blue info notification
- `addToast(type, message, duration?)` - Shows a custom toast with specified type

### Parameters

- `message` (string): The text to display in the notification
- `duration` (number, optional): How long to show the toast in milliseconds (default: 5000ms)

### Examples

```tsx
// Show a success message
showSuccess('Blog post created successfully!');

// Show an error message
showError('Failed to save changes');

// Show a warning message
showWarning('Please fill in all required fields');

// Show an info message
showInfo('Your changes have been auto-saved');

// Show a custom duration toast
showSuccess('Quick message', 2000); // Shows for 2 seconds
```

## Toast Types

1. **Success** - Green background, checkmark icon
2. **Error** - Red background, alert circle icon  
3. **Warning** - Yellow background, alert triangle icon
4. **Info** - Blue background, info icon

## Features

- ✅ Auto-dismiss after 5 seconds (configurable)
- ✅ Manual dismiss with X button
- ✅ Different colors and icons for different message types
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Smooth animations
- ✅ Multiple toasts can be shown simultaneously
- ✅ Stacked layout in top-right corner
- ✅ High z-index to appear above other content

## Migration from Alerts

The following components have been updated to use the toaster system:

- `BlogManagement.tsx` - Blog CRUD operations
- `TeamManagement.tsx` - Team member CRUD operations  
- `ProjectManagement.tsx` - Project CRUD operations
- `PackageManagement.tsx` - Package CRUD operations
- `auth/page.tsx` - Authentication messages

### Before (using alerts):
```tsx
alert('Blog created successfully');
alert('Error: Failed to save');
```

### After (using toaster):
```tsx
showSuccess('Blog created successfully');
showError('Failed to save');
```

## Demo Component

A demo component is available at `src/components/dashboard/ToasterDemo.tsx` that showcases all the different toast types and features. You can import and use this component to test the toaster system.

## Styling

The toaster uses Tailwind CSS classes and is styled to match the dark theme of the dashboard. The notifications appear in the top-right corner with a dark background, colored borders, and appropriate icons for each message type.

## Accessibility

- Each toast has a unique ID for proper tracking
- Icons are semantic and represent the message type
- Close button is clearly visible and clickable
- Text contrast meets accessibility standards
